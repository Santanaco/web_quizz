# WEB QUIZZ

## Description

As a coding bootcamp student, I wanted to make a quiz for a fun way to help retain basic information about things that we are learning. I used tools that I learned in DOM to help build this quiz. The quiz is timed so user will have to think somewhat quickly on their answers before time runs out. Scores will be added at the end and presented, as well as leave their mark by providing initials. 

## Installation ðŸ¤¯

Remember DOM methods. Move questions & answers page into the JavaScript file. The start page, end page, and high scores page should remain in html to help divide the pages up. Set up a timer to decrease by one second starting from 75 seconds. Organize the functions so everything will run smoothly. Utilize local storage to pull initials that user input and the total sum of the score. Remember to add a button that will take user back to the beginning to take quiz again.

## Usage

The user will begin at the start page where an explanation of the quiz is presented. The user then clicks "Start Quiz" to start quiz as well as the timer. User has 75 seconds to complete the quiz. There are nine questions total. Correct answers will earn the user ten points, and wrong answers will deduct ten seconds from the timer. Once the quiz comes to an end, or the user runs out of time, the screen will display total score and have a box for the user to input their initials and a submit button. There will also be a link at the top left corner where the user can go back and review high scores.
